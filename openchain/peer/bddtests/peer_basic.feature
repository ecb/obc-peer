#  @chaincodeImagesUpToDate use this if all scenarios chaincode images are up to date, and do NOT require building.  BE SURE!!!

Feature: lanching 3 peers
    As an openchain developer
    I want to be able to launch a 3 peers

#    @doNotDecompose
#    @wip
	Scenario: chaincode example 02 single peer 
	    Given we compose "docker-compose-1.yml"
	    And I wait "1" seconds
	    When requesting "/chain" from "vp0"
	    Then I should get a JSON response with "height" = "1"
	    When I deploy chaincode "github.com/openblockchain/obc-peer/openchain/example/chaincode/chaincode_example02" with ctor "init" to "vp0"
		     | arg1 |  arg2 | arg3 | arg4 |
		     |  a   |  100  |  b   |  200 |
	    Then I should have received a chaincode name 
	    Then I wait up to "25" seconds for transaction to be committed to all peers
	    
	    When requesting "/chain" from "vp0"
	    Then I should get a JSON response with "height" = "2"

        When I query chaincode "example2" function name "query" on "vp0":
            |arg1|
            |  a |
	    Then I should get a JSON response with "OK" = "100"


        When I invoke chaincode "example2" function name "invoke" on "vp0"
			|arg1|arg2|arg3| 
			| a  | b  | 10 |
	    Then I should have received a transactionID
	    Then I wait up to "25" seconds for transaction to be committed to all peers

	    When requesting "/chain" from "vp0"
	    Then I should get a JSON response with "height" = "3"

            |arg1|
            |  a |
	    Then I should get a JSON response with "OK" = "90"
        
        When I query chaincode "example2" function name "query" on "vp0":
            |arg1|
            |  b |
	    Then I should get a JSON response with "OK" = "210"

	Scenario: basic startup of 3 validating peers
	    Given we compose "docker-compose-3.yml"
	    When requesting "/chain" from "vp0"
	    Then I should get a JSON response with "height" = "1"
